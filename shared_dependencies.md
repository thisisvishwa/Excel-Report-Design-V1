1. **Python Classes and Functions**: The Python files (`__init__.py`, `report_designer.py`, `main.py`, `test_report_designer.py`) will share classes and functions. The main class will likely be `ReportDesigner` in `report_designer.py`, with methods corresponding to the functional requirements. The `__init__.py` files will be used to import these classes and functions where needed.

2. **Odoo Models**: The Python files will also share Odoo models, such as `ir.model`, `ir.model.fields`, and a custom `report.designer` model.

3. **XML IDs**: The XML and JavaScript files (`report_designer_views.xml`, `report_designer_templates.xml`, `report_designer.xml`) will share XML IDs for form views, tree views, actions, menus, and templates. These IDs will be used to reference elements across files.

4. **JavaScript Functions and Variables**: The JavaScript file (`report_designer.js`) will contain functions and variables used in the client-side functionality of the module. These may include functions for handling user interactions, manipulating the DOM, and communicating with the server.

5. **CSS Classes**: The CSS file (`report_designer.css`) will define styles for the module's user interface. These class names will be shared with the XML and JavaScript files, which will apply the styles to the appropriate elements.

6. **Test Cases**: The test file (`test_report_designer.py`) will reference the same classes, functions, and models as the other Python files to test the module's functionality.

7. **Data Files**: The data file (`report_designer_data.xml`) will likely contain initial configuration data for the module, such as default report templates. This data will be referenced by the Python and XML files.

8. **Security Rules**: The security file (`ir.model.access.csv`) will define access rules for the module's models. These rules will reference the same models as the Python files.

9. **Module Information**: The manifest file (`__manifest__.py`) will contain metadata about the module, such as its name, version, dependencies, and the names of all the other files.
